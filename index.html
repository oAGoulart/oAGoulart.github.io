              I'm a computer science student and I have a great interest for linguistics, design, history, politics and, you guessed it, computers. This page is just an aggregation of links to some of my projects/work and random stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
              I got my introduction to coding through scripting mods for video games, after that I learned C, C++, and Assembly with some mixed results. After a while, I started learning some high-level programming languages, like Python, Lua, Go and Ruby. Still, I prefer to code in C and/or C++.

          <p class="subtitle is-7">
            Deep Learning is a branch of Machine Learning (ML) focusing on so-called deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These ANNs are composed of several processing layers that have the capacity to assimilate knowledge at varying levels of abstraction. Deep learning has enabled significant advances in large-scale data processing in diverse domains, including computer networks and distributed systems, biology, computer vision, and speech recognition. The general objective of this research project is to investigate and propose machine learning techniques in general, with an emphasis on deep learning, as a mechanism for providing intelligence for computer networks and distributed systems.

          <h6 class="title is-7">RAF Program - Family Farming Tracking</h6>
          <p class="subtitle is-7">
            The Family Farming Products Traceability Program (PRORAF)'s main objective is to enable traceability and generate quality seals for products generated by family farming. In this sense, three specific objectives are aimed at: qualifying family farming data, promoting community labeling and evolving underlying information systems. The PRORAF executing team will hold periodic meetings to discuss and organize, collaboratively, the actions to be carried out to meet each of its specific objectives. In this way, the program will allow academics, teachers and TAES and members of the external community to debate and act on the reality of local family farming, in a transdisciplinary and interprofessional way. The program is related to one of the subprojects of the umbrella research, development and innovation project called "Center for Agrotechnology and Innovation of Pampa Cluster of research, development, innovation and business: from family farming to industrial production", which is supported by FAPERGS within the scope of EDITAL FAPERGS 02/2022 - INOVA CLUSTERS TECNOLÓGICOS.

          <h6 class="title is-7">Clube Open Source</h6>
          <p class="subtitle is-7">
            The use of open collaboration principles in software development has proven important for several industries. These principles facilitate the sharing of knowledge and experiences according to the possibilities of each developer, regardless of hierarchical levels and/or technical qualifications, which favors the technical and interpersonal maturity of teams. This project aims to establish the Clube Open Source (COS) to introduce and disseminate the principles of open collaboration, enabling technologies and open source products in the academic environment. These objectives will be achieved through technical workshops aimed at undergraduate students at the Alegrete campus. As a result, we hope to improve the quality of the software developed, in addition to qualifying students' technical and interpersonal skills.
