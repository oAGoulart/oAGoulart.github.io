Hello there! If you are here and don't know me, I'm **_Jos√© Augusto dos Santos Goulart_** (or just **Augusto**), a computer science undergraduate with a great passion for linguistics, design, history, politics, and you've guessed it, computers. This page is just an aggregation of links to some of my projects/works and random stuff.

## About me

I had my introduction to coding through scripting mods for video games, after that I picked up on C, C++, and Assembly with some mixed results as far as my learning experience went. After some more time I was introduced to more high-level programming languages (thanks to one of my CS professors) such as Python, Lua, Go, and Ruby. Still, I prefer to code with C and/or C++.

Here, have a drawing of my cat **_Lily_** I made when I started learning how to use vector graphics:
