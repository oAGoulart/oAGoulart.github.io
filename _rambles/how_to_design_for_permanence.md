title: How to design for permanence
---

If you ever worked a service job, you'll know that the phrase "the customer is always right" is the complete opposite in reality. The customer is never right, humans are very poorly equipped to make decisions based on what they _think_ they want. So why have us, developers, made design "thinking" revolve around the customer? I think most of us know the answer to that question: __consumerism__. The contemporary human condition knows only two truths: _(a)_ making goods; and _(b)_ consuming said goods.

But who's job is it to define _how_ a good is made? The designer. That is to say, __WE__, who design software, are the problem. The most recent example of this _designer-motivated_ push to label "monotony" as obsolete is the "AI" bubble. Everything must be done through LLMs, it has been inserted into every interface possible, but to what end? Most users did not wish for this -- which is what has been driving this constant need for "innovation", some may say "disruption". No, the answer is even more disturbing: you must make things up to justify the company's share value. We have gone from a "consumer" market to a "speculation" market.

This market, whoever or whatever it is meant to appeal to, does not create products that are meant to last, it focuses solely on increasing share value, as much and as quickly as possible. But why has this dominated the software industry? __Monopolies__! Why would emerging companies try to make a lasting product when they know they can't compete in the long term with the likes of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta, etc. It is not enough to have a functional product that people use, and that makes a profit, you __must__ increase share value.

Think of a house, you'll need foundations; a core structure; the inner works; then, lastly, the aesthetics. But what if you keep adding things that were never meant to be there? A whole new upper floor maybe? That house will collapse. And I know what you might be thinking: wasn't the Agile method created specifically because software development does not have the same associated risks as traditional engineering projects? Yes. But, just because there are no risks, does not mean it can't collapse. And this is what I'm trying to show: software is never _done_, but somehow it is never _permanent_ either.

Yet, maybe it doesn't need to be this way. I understand this (i.e. consumerism) is a broader issue, and when I say _permanence_ I don't mean "it will be used forever", rather, I mean "it is a _solution_ to a _problem_ that is not transitory". This requires you, as a designer, to define the software architecture on paper, before trying to implement it, which is, by definition, the antithesis to Agile. To make something long-lasting, it must not be made for the market; customer preferences, shareholder speculation, are transitory and volatile.

As more and more things around us turn towards some form of design for "impermanence" (e.g. architecture), it is important for us to _(a)_ not allow ourselves to _just_ follow trends; _(b)_ police our creations' impact in the world beyond material interests; and _(c)_ __care__, as in, putting effort into what you produce. At last, remember, permanence requires something to be _done_, but not to be _permanent_ (I know).

_Human design, by humans, for humans._
