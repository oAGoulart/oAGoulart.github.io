title: Looking back at my HS graduation speech
---

At the end of 2018, I took on the task, with my friend Ariane, to make our graduation class' speech.
Recently, while going through some backup files, I have found the original text that we wrote -- some credit also goes to Giovana. Anyhow, I thought it would be nice to share it.

_Translated from Portuguese; some expressions are less impactful in English._

Ariane:
> Good evening to all our sublime graduates and guests. First of all, I would like to thank everyone who was with me and always helped me. I would also like to be thankful for the honor of being here to share these words.
> For long periods of our lives, we have reflected on what it would be like to go from one very important stage to another; for today, here we are, graduating. When I look back, I remember thinking about what it would be like to go from fifth grade to sixth grade, or from elementary school to high school, and, recently, whether I would be able to attend an university. However, everything happens differently from how we imagined it.
> As children, we were asked what we wanted to be when we grew up, and the answer was usually on the tip of our tongue: firefighter, police officer, doctor, astronaut, soccer player. Today, grown up and thoughtful, about to face the world out there, we are convinced of the importance of our professional choice, as well as its difficulties and gratifications. When I recall all that time we spent together, discovering and rediscovering each other and ourselves, I remember the games, the relaxed conversations, the outings, the parties, the teachers and especially the friends. I will miss everything and everyone.
> However, we will never forget the debates in sociology class, the excitement at all times, the improvised projects at the last minute, the meticulously planned cheat sheets, the dinners at teacher Sandra's house – by the way, sorry about the floor – the class camping trip. In short, we have many memories to keep and remember.

Augusto:
> Good evening to everyone here today.
> First of all, I must say: the result of the experiment was positive, the level of satisfaction was equal to PI squared, we reasoned like Aristotle, our panorama was a painting by Van Gogh and in the midst of so many living beings and cells, wars and independence, plains and depressions, proclisis and mesoclisis, the purest and noblest relationships that exist in the universe emerged: fraternity, friendship, love, loyalty and admiration. From now on, we will most likely not meet so often, as each one of us will follow and forge their own path, facing difficulties and pursuing their own dreams. Some will soon attend university, others will prefer to work, perhaps the rest will think about doing other things, however, the most important thing is that everyone follows their intended path and that they are happy. Despite all this, we will remember all our moments together, serving as inspiration for us to create new experiences, always remembering the knowledge absorbed, not only in the classroom, but in the coexistence inside and outside the school, with teachers, staff and students.
> To conclude this speech, I will quote a hopeful phrase from educator, pedagogue and philosopher Paulo Freire:
>> “There is no transition that does not imply a starting point, a process and a point of arrival. Every tomorrow is created in a yesterday, through a today. So our future is based on the past and embodied in the present. We have to know what we were and what we are, in order to know what we will be.”

_This was a nice piece to remember. I am glad that I have kept it!_
